AutoShot is a Chrome Extension that takes screenshots at regular intervals and save them to a specified location.
You can choose the interval of screenshots in seconds, minutes, and hours.
You can specify the folder name like XYZ and the sub-folder name like XYZ\ABC.
All the captured screenshots will be saved to your C drive's downloads folder (by default).
